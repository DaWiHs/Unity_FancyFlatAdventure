# Unity_FancyFlatAdventure
 1st ever game, made for school's science picninc in collaboration of classmate

 It was my first ever "full" game on Unity, made in ~2018 with classmate, Natalia G., who was in charge of graphics.

 Side-scroll platformer with 3 levels of jump (Low/Mid/High), some handbuilt levels, and endless mode. Supports 2 players and highscores.
 
 It was my first big project, code there is a total mess (but works, won 2nd place), so I don't intend to touch it but the idea and world builds can be reused surely.

FancyFlatAdventure.rar contains archived .exe, if you want to try it.
